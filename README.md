# Quantified ChatGPT

### Dialogue Repository, Data Analysis and Data Visualization for ChatGPT Export

"Quantified ChatGPT" is an open-source Jupyter Notebook tool designed to help you gain insights into your interactions with ChatGPT. Convert your ChatGPT conversation history into human-readable exports (in markdown), structured data (i.e. csv). Then analyze and visualize your chat data for a better understanding of your dialogues and a repository for quantifying your interactions with ChatGPT over time. 

### Code / Dependencies: 

* The code is written in Python 3. 
* Shared and distributed via Jupyter Notebooks. 
* View detailed [Installation Notes on QS Ledger Github project](https://github.com/markwk/qs_ledger).
* Note: There are a few added libraries you should `pip install` - Additional Docs/Help ðŸ˜ˆ COMING SOON ðŸŽ‰


### Basic Usage / Quickstart

- Export your ChatGPT history and data following OpenAI's documentation [here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7260999-how-do-i-export-my-chatgpt-history-and-data).
- Extract ZIP. 
- Place the file `conversations.json` into `data` directory such that the file is available at `data/conversations.json`
- First run `chatpt_data_parser.ipynb` using either jupyter notebook or jupyter lab which will convert your raw JSON file into a simple CSV/spreadsheet. [Markdown converter coming soon]
- Second run `chatpt_data_analysis.ipynb` for data analysis, data visualization and some charts on your ChatGPT utilization.
